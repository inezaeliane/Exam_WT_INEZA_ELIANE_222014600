The Investment Portfolio Tracker system is designed to provide comprehensive management and tracking of various investment types within user-defined portfolios.
Each table is carefully structured to store specific details about users, portfolios, investments, transactions, and performance metrics.
The system ensures data integrity and enables detailed analysis and reporting, 
helping users make informed investment decisions and maintain a balanced investment strategy.
